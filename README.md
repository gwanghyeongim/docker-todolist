# docker-todolist
This todo-list app is the result of my Docker tutorial practice.

For more, install [docker desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and run `docker run -dp 80:80 docker/getting-started` in terminal, and visit your [localhost](http://localhost/tutorial/) to follow todo-app tutorial. 

After the tutorial, you will have a nice todo-list app made with MySQl and Node.js with the help of Docker.
